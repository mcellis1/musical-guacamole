# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

The goal for this project wass to build an interaactive website that logs the name and salary information for multiple employees and averages their income. Functions are created to prompt the user to enter the name and income information for employees, as many times as needed. The employee income iss averaged, and a random employee is selected.

This project was a great learning exercise on how to implement information into an array and use javascript functionality to access that array. There are a couple math functions going on as well like taking the average of the employee salaries. Implementing the while loop was a bitt challenging at first, but eventually the code matched the expected outcome.

## Installation

In order to access the application, navigate to the github pages link: https://mcellis1.github.io/musical-guacamole/

## Usage

When navigating to the webpage, the usser will need to click the "Add Employees" button to initiate the script to add the employee salaries to the spreadsheet.

The user will then be prompted to enter the first name, last name, and salary of the employee. The user can continue to submit as many employee's information as they need until they select "cancel".
