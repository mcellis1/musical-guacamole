# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

The goal for this project is to build an interactive website that logs the name and salary information for multiple employees and averages their income. Functions are created to prompt the user to enter the name and income information for employees, as many times as needed. The employee income is averaged, and a random employee is selected as a giveaway winner.

This project is a great learning exercise on how to implement information into an array and use javascript functionality to access that array. There are a couple math functions going on as well like taking the average of the employee salaries. Implementing the while loop is a bit challenging at first, but eventually the code matches the expected outcome.

## Installation

In order to access the application, navigate to the github pages link: https://mcellis1.github.io/musical-guacamole/

## Usage

When navigating to the webpage, the user needs to click the "Add Employees" button to initiate the script to add the employee salaries to the spreadsheet.

The user is then prompted to enter the first name, last name, and salary of the employee. The user continues to submit as many employee's information as needed until "cancel" is selected.

Open the console log with Chrome Dev Tools to see the average salary calculated and logged, as well a random emmployee selected to win a giveaway.
